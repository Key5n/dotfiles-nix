description: Commit and Open a draft Pull Request
---

Open a draft Pull Request for the current branch.
Use the outline below, but adapt it as needed.

## Requirements

- If the repository has a Pull Request template, use it as the base.
- If there are no commits on the current branch, commit the working tree with a concise title.
- Use the commit message as the Pull Request title, and write the title in Japanese.
- If no remote branch exists, run `git push`.
- Include enough detail to describe the changes clearly.
- Maintain a professional tone.
- Write the Pull Request in Japanese.

## Recommended Sections

Use Markdown headers in the Pull Request body, for example:

```markdown
## 背景

## 変更概要
```

Explain the "変更概要" section as clearly and precisely as possible.
