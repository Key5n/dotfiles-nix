description: Commit and Open a draft Pull Request
---

Commit the current worktree with a concise title.
Open a draft Pull Request of the current branch with the default title (commit message).
The description should follow the next format (you should fill each section if necessary):

```
# 目的

# 実装内容

# UI スクリーンショット（見た目に変更がある場合のみ）

```

But you don't have to fill the UI screenshots section by (e.g.) uploading UI screenshots now because it is done manually.
